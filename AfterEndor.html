                Luke Skywalker is an entirely different man in legends and ep 7. In legends he is this great warrior willing to do anything to help the galaxy. While in ep 7 he is an old man with no more hopes and dreams just living the rest of his life secluded on an island waiting to die.

                The galaxy itself is really different, in Legends they comes a Galactic invasion force called the Yuuzhan Vong. These Devel like aliens all worship a god who revels in the pain inflicted and the pain others inflict on his followers. They have a Hate for all machines and only use bio equipment and ships. While in the Disney cannon the galaxy has risen another ‘Empire’ called the First Order, they built another ‘Death Star’ called Starkiller Base. Which is bigger and badder than the last one.
